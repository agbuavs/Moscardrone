Quadcopter - Arduino project, using nRF24L01 for the data link and a PC Joystick as a remote controller


I am doing this project in my spare time. I hope the code will be useful to anyone interested in making its own quadcopter with the capability to customise the data link protocol and the remote controller.

I am using 2 Arduino Uno boards and 2 nRF24l01 transceivers, one pair for the quadcopter segment and another for the ground segment.

Currently, I implemented only the MPU6050 sensor board (gyroscope and accelerometer). Implementation of GPS, barometer, ultrasonics and FPV might be done in the future.


I will post information and comments about the project in my website: http://agbuavs.wordpress.com/moscardrone/
